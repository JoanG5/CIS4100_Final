## MTAROUTEPLANNER

The Subway Route Planner is a Python-based project designed to help users navigate the New York City subway system efficiently. This tool utilizes Dijkstra's algorithm to find the shortest route and estimated travel time between two subway stations. It incorporates real-time data, including subway schedules and station information, to provide accurate and up-to-date results.

## Features
Graph-based Algorithm: Implements Dijkstra's algorithm to calculate the shortest path between subway stations, considering both travel time and station connections.

Real-time Subway Data: Integrates with the MTA (Metropolitan Transportation Authority) API to fetch live subway schedules, ensuring the most current information is used for route planning.

User-friendly Interface: The project includes an HTML interface for users to select their starting and ending stations, providing a seamless and intuitive experience.
